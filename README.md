## Our Features
This section is currently on hold, as we are going through some *major* reconstruction and changes throughout the entire plugin.
Once things start to settle down, this feature list will be reinstated and fully up-to-date!

For the time being, install the plugin to check the options out, or swing by the [discord](https://discord.gg/xT7zyjzjtY) server for more info.
Thanks!
